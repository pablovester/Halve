# My portfolio

Hey everyone! Welcome to my portfolio.
I am front end devwho wants to learn as much as he can and help others to create the best functional, readable and clean code possible. I seek to become a fullstack dev because I believe that either the back or the front end benefits from understanding the other end. 

Check out my resume in the links section and projects in the namesake section or feel free to send me a message, too. See you around!
