# My portfolio

Hey everyone! Welcome to my portfolio. I put this site up to display my projects, my resume and let anyone contact/message me more easily.
I haven been coding for only a couple of years but I'm in this for the long game. Though nowadays I aim to be a front end developer, I seek to become a full stack developer. I want to be present in the whole development cycle and contribute where I can, because I believe that one end benefits from understanding the other one. 
Above all, I want to keep on moving forward, I want to learn as much as I can and help others to create the best functional, readable and clean code that we can.

Check out my resume in the links section and projects in the namesake section or eel free to send me a message, too.

See you around!
